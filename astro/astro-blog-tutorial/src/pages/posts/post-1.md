Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro!

## What I've accomplished so far
1. **Installing Astro**: First I created a new Astro project and set up some account stuff on GitHub and Netlify
2. **Making Pages**: Then I created new `.astro` files to create the first few pages
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post on Astro, written in Markdown!

## What's Next
I will finish this tutorial as part of my learning in public
